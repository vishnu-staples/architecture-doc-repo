Today, our .ca site maintains its own cart data but relies on Shopify for cart state and rules, which limits customization and prevents a seamless express\u2011checkout experience. Consolidating cart and checkout in a single application removes cross\u2011app friction, unlocks rapid iteration on cart UX/logic, and reduces vendor lock\u2011in.</p> <p>Primary Objectives - Unify cart and checkout to provide a single, streamlined purchase flow. - Fully replace the Shopify-managed cart on .ca with our in-house cart, enabling express checkout on cart, richer promotions, targeted merchandising, and experimentation. - Improve reliability, performance, and observability by owning the full funnel.</p> <p>Scope (at a glance) - Rebuild cart domain logic, APIs, and UI under the checkout application. - Implement and validate core capabilities natively (pricing, discounts, taxes, shipping estimates, analytics/attribution) and decommission the Shopify cart on .ca. - Roll out behind feature flags with gradual audience expansion and clear rollback.</p>"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#raci","title":"RACI","text":"<p>RACI = a simple responsibility model for each major task/deliverable: - R \u2014 Responsible: does the work. - A \u2014 Accountable: the single owner who signs off - C \u2014 Consulted: gives input before decisions (two-way). - I \u2014 Informed: kept up to date (one-way).</p> Deliverable / Activity PO Architect Tech Lead Dev Team QA Security System/Domain architecture &amp; data model I A I I I C Cart API ownership &amp; state management I C A R I C Observability I C A R I C Rollback plan A C R R I C"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#feature-requirements","title":"Feature Requirements","text":""},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#must-have","title":"Must Have","text":"<ol> <li>Add/Update/Remove items from the Cart</li> <li>Move for Later</li> <li>Wish List</li> <li>GWP (Gift With Purchase)</li> <li>Pricing/Discount/Product Summary detailed along with images</li> <li>Express checkout</li> <li>APIs to external services that includes Segment, Klaviyo and other platforms</li> </ol>"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#should-have","title":"Should Have","text":"<ol> <li>Save Cart for logged in users across devices</li> <li>When logging in from multiple cart, should be merged with previous cart items</li> <li>Recently viewed</li> </ol>"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#could-have","title":"Could Have","text":"<ol> <li>Coupons</li> <li>Recommendations</li> </ol>"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/#wont-have","title":"Won't Have","text":"<ol> <li>Same domain as <code>http://staples.ca</code> - Will be part of checkout domain</li> </ol>"},{"location":"services/staples_ca/cart/architecture/","title":"Lucid Diagram","text":""},{"location":"services/staples_ca/pre/","title":"Staples CA","text":"<p>This diagram shows the high-level component architecture of PRE</p> <p> </p>"}]}
